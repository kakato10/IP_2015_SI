# Introduction to programming 2015/2016 Software Engineering
Well this will be the repository, that will store all materials and tasks related to the "Introduction to programming" 2015 course for Software Enginnering at FMI, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski". 

##Behind, every programming student there's a lot of pizza and coffee!

I hope you like thoose two above, because they're going to be very helpful during the course. Basically, in this course we're going to cover a lot of interesting topics related mostly to C++. I will do my best to give you a good idea about how things happen not only in the context of C++ but in programming at all. There are going to be a lot of tasks so that you can practice what you've already learned. Hopefully at the end of the course you'll have an enormous boost in your programming skills so that you can start building your dream career as fast as possible.
