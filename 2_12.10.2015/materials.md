Materials
=====================

Great, you've opened the file for additional materials. If you're here, I gues that the things, that we've talked about in class are not enough for you and you're eager to learn something more. In that case the links below should do the work.

Testing something.

* A [presentation](http://www.letu.edu/people/stevearmstrong/COSC%201303/NellDale%20Lectures/chapter%202.ppt), which can be considered as a summary of what you have learned already. It also contains information about other aspects of C++, that we're yet to talk about;

* http://cs.smu.ca/~porter/csc/ref/cpp_keywords.html - more info about reserved words and standard words (in the material they are called "predefined identifiers")

* http://www.ntchosting.com/encyclopedia/scripting-and-programming/script/ - an interesting article about scirps, which explains why do we need them and where can we actually use them

That's for now. 
Wish you a pleasent reading!
