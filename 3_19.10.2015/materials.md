Materials time!
=====================
Well we've learned a bit about variables and variable types that are used in C++. Here you can find a bit more additional information about them.
* [variables and variable types](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/);
* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_types.htm - memory usage of the primitive types of C++;

So we've also talked about boolean expressions. What are they, why do we use them and so on. Basically in these materials you can find again some more knowledge about them.
* [basic boolean expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VveLH3m6cfA)
* [compound boolean expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHNG4ODjrd8)

And of course something about C++ libraries. In that [list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/) are mentioned a lot of them. Maybe the most useful once.
