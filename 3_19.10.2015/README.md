Booleans, double/float, type convertion and libraries
=====================

##Task 1: USA congress elections

Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter information about 4 things, related to himself.
* his age;
* since when does he have a US citizenship;
* has he ever commited a crime;
* is he mentally stable;

After that your program should decide whether this person can participate as a candidate for a US Senator.
Here are the requirements that he should satisfy:
* he should be at least 30 years old;
* he should be a US citizen for at least 9 years;
* he must have not commited a crime until now;
* he should be mentally stable;

Example usage
 * Input:
	```
	Your age: 20
	US citizen since: 10
	Any commited crimes: 1 
	Mentally stable: 1
	```
	Output:
	```
	You can participate in the elections: false
	```
 * Input:
	```
	Your age: 37
	US citizen since: 15
	Any commited crimes: 0 
	Mentally stable: 1
	```
	Output:
	```
	You can participate in the elections: true
	```
 * Input:
	```
	Your age: 42
	US citizen since: 42
	Any commited crimes: 0 
	Mentally stable: 0
	```
	Output:
	```
	You can participate in the elections: false
	```
	
##Task 2: Explore the library!

Using fuctions from an appropriate libraries, write a C++ program, which:
 * computes and displays the square of a number 4;
 * computes and displays the square root of 4;
 * finds and displays the absolute value of -4;
 * rounds a rational number and displays the result;
 * finds the biggest element;
 * displays the count of seconds from 1 Jan 1970 (Epoch time);
 * displays a random int number between 0 and 42;
 
###Good luck!
